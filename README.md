Performing tasks using the Bash shell

I executed following commands:

Open the home directory.

Determine the name of the folder you are currently in.

Create a directory named "test1" inside that folder.

Navigate to the "test1" directory.

Create files named "1", "2", and "3" inside the "test1" directory.

Check the contents of the "test1" directory.

Go back to the home directory.

Create a folder named "test2" inside the home directory.

Delete the "test2" folder.

Delete the "2" file from the "test1" folder.

Create a folder named "test3" in the home directory and add two files to it.

Delete the "test3" folder.

Create a folder named "test4" in the home directory.

Move files "1" and "3" from the "test1" folder to the "test4" folder.

Add three lines with the word "line" to file "1".

View the contents of file "1".

View the contents of both files (1 and 3) simultaneously.

Using one of the editors, replace all occurrences of the word "line" in file "1".
